**Pharma Manufacturing RCA AI Agent** is an advanced, user-friendly web application built with **Streamlit** that automates the **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** of batch processes in pharmaceutical manufacturing. It allows engineers and operations teams to quickly visualize batch statuses, access logs, download detailed RCA reports, and improve operational efficiency.

## Project Overview
This tool automates the **RCA process** for batch production in pharma plants, helping teams detect failed batches, track pipeline issues, and implement preventive measures. The system generates **well-structured RCA reports in Word format** and displays detailed pipeline, source, and app database logs.

---

## Key Features
- ✅ **Batch Input & Filters**: Enter single, multiple, or range of batch numbers with status filters (Success/Failed).  
- ✅ **Dynamic Batch Analysis**: Separate views for successful and failed batches.  
- ✅ **Interactive Tabs**: View pipeline logs, source DB, app DB, and download RCA reports.  
- ✅ **Automated RCA Report Generation**: DOCX reports with incident summary, root cause, corrective/preventive actions, and confidence scores.  
- ✅ **Responsive UI**: Modern card-based design with collapsible sections for clean visualization.  
- ✅ **Detailed Pipeline Metrics**: Logs include `job_id`, `batch_id`, `status`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and `error`.  
- ✅ **Multiple Batch Support**: Supports batch ranges like `BATCH-001 to BATCH-005` or comma-separated batches.

## UI Components & Interactions
- **Batch Input Field** – compact text input for entering batch IDs.  
- **Filters** – select “All,” “Success,” or “Failed” batches.  
- **Result Cards** – collapsible, color-coded cards:  
  - **Red**: Failed batches  
  - **Green**: Successful batches  
- **Tabs inside cards**:
  1. **Pipeline Logs** – shows ETL job logs.  
  2. **Source DB** – displays the batch data from source DB.  
  3. **App DB** – displays batch data from application DB.  
  4. **Download RCA** – download ready-to-use Word report.  


---

## Use Cases
1. **Operations Monitoring** – Track which batches failed and why.  
2. **Audit & Compliance** – Maintain structured RCA reports for regulatory compliance.  
3. **ETL Pipeline Verification** – Detect ETL or data pipeline issues quickly.  
4. **Decision Support** – Helps managers decide preventive actions based on confidence scores and logs.  
5. **Batch Trend Analysis** – Analyze batch failures over time for predictive maintenance.
